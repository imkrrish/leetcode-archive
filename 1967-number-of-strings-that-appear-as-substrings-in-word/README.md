## Problem Statement
<p>Given an array of strings <code>patterns</code> and a string <code>word</code>, return <em>the <strong>number</strong> of strings in </em><code>patterns</code><em> that exist as a <strong>substring</strong> in </em><code>word</code>.</p>

<p>A <strong>substring</strong> is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> patterns = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;abc&quot;,&quot;bc&quot;,&quot;d&quot;], word = &quot;abc&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- &quot;a&quot; appears as a substring in &quot;<u>a</u>bc&quot;.
- &quot;abc&quot; appears as a substring in &quot;<u>abc</u>&quot;.
- &quot;bc&quot; appears as a substring in &quot;a<u>bc</u>&quot;.
- &quot;d&quot; does not appear as a substring in &quot;abc&quot;.
3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> patterns = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;], word = &quot;aaaaabbbbb&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- &quot;a&quot; appears as a substring in &quot;a<u>a</u>aaabbbbb&quot;.
- &quot;b&quot; appears as a substring in &quot;aaaaabbbb<u>b</u>&quot;.
- &quot;c&quot; does not appear as a substring in &quot;aaaaabbbbb&quot;.
2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> patterns = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;a&quot;], word = &quot;ab&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word &quot;<u>a</u>b&quot;.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= patterns.length &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= patterns[i].length &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= word.length &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>patterns[i]</code> and <code>word</code> consist of lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>


## Examples
**Example 1:**
- **Input:** `patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"`
- **Output:** `3`
- **Explanation:** - "a" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "abc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "bc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".
3 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** `patterns = ["a","b","c"], word = "aaaaabbbbb"`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** - "a" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
- "b" appears as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
- "c" does not appear as a substring in "aaaaabbbbb".
2 of the strings in patterns appear as a substring in word.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** `patterns = ["a","a","a"], word = "ab"`
- **Output:** `3`
- **Explanation:** Each of the patterns appears as a substring in word "ab".

## Constraints
- 1 <= patterns.length <= 100
- 1 <= patterns[i].length <= 100
- 1 <= word.length <= 100
- patterns[i] and word consist of lowercase English letters.

## Hints
- Deal with each of the patterns individually.
- Use the built-in function in the language you are using to find if the pattern exists as a substring in <code>word</code>.
