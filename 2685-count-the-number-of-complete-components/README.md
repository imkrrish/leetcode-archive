## Problem Statement
<p>You are given an integer <code>n</code>. There is an <strong>undirected</strong> graph with <code>n</code> vertices, numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>. You are given a 2D integer array <code>edges</code> where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes that there exists an <strong>undirected</strong> edge connecting vertices <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the number of <strong>complete connected components</strong> of the graph</em>.</p>

<p>A <strong>connected component</strong> is a subgraph of a graph in which there exists a path between any two vertices, and no vertex of the subgraph shares an edge with a vertex outside of the subgraph.</p>

<p>A connected component is said to be <b>complete</b> if there exists an edge between every pair of its vertices.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> From the picture above, one can see that all of the components of this graph are complete.

<p><strong class="example"><img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/04/11/screenshot-from-2023-04-11-23-32-00.png" style="width: 671px; height: 270px;" /></strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4],[3,5]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The component containing vertices 0, 1, and 2 is complete since there is an edge between every pair of two vertices. On the other hand, the component containing vertices 3, 4, and 5 is not complete since there is no edge between vertices 4 and 5. Thus, the number of complete components in this graph is 1.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 50</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= edges.length &lt;= n * (n - 1) / 2</code></li>
	<li><code>edges[i].length == 2</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> &lt;= n - 1</code></li>
	<li><code>a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub></code></li>
	<li>There are no repeated edges.</li>
</ul>


## Examples
**Example 1:**
- **Input:** `n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4]]`
- **Output:** `3`
- **Explanation:** From the picture above, one can see that all of the components of this graph are complete.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** `n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4],[3,5]]`
- **Output:** `1`
- **Explanation:** The component containing vertices 0, 1, and 2 is complete since there is an edge between every pair of two vertices. On the other hand, the component containing vertices 3, 4, and 5 is not complete since there is no edge between vertices 4 and 5. Thus, the number of complete components in this graph is 1.

## Constraints
- 1 <= n <= 50
- 0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
- edges[i].length == 2
- 0 <= a_i, b_i <= n - 1
- a_i != b_i
- There are no repeated edges.

## Hints
- Find the connected components of an undirected graph using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS).
- For each connected component, count the number of nodes and edges in the component.
- A connected component is complete if and only if the number of edges in the component is equal to m*(m-1)/2, where m is the number of nodes in the component.
